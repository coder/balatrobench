Then discard indices 4,5,6,7 (C_8, D_8, D_7, H_2). That's 4 cards discarding, draws 4 new cards. After discarding, we will have 8 cards: the 4 we kept plus 4 new.\n\nLet's do a discard action.\n\nWe also might consider playing a Hand now for score, but we want to maximize score, maybe we can still get points from discarding? No points.\n\nWe need total 256 more points. If we get Straight after discard, we get 320 > needed. So we can discard then play Straight.\n\nThus step1: discard [4,5,6,7] (the non-high cards). Reasoning as above.\n\nThen we will have new hand of 8 cards: keep Ace, Queen, Jack, Ten plus 4 random draws. After draw, we aim to have a K.

However there is some confusion: The recent decision history seems off; they refer to cards not present. Probably example. Our actual current hand is:\n\n0: C_A (Ace of Clubs)\n1: S_K (King of Spades)\n2: C_Q (Queen of Clubs)\n3: S_J (Jack of Spades)\n4: S_T (Ten of Spades)\n5: C_9 (Nine of Clubs)\n6: S_7 (Seven of Spades)\n7: S_3 (Three of Spades)\n\nWe have 3 hands left (total 4 per round; we have used 1?). Current score is 44. Target 300. Need 256 more.\n\nWe have no jokers, no consumables. So we need to make high scoring hands with these cards. Let's evaluate possible hands.\n\nWe have many Spades: K,J,T,7,3 (5 spades). Also clubs: Ace, Queen, 9 (3 clubs). Could aim for a Flush (5 spades) => Flush base chips 35, mult 4. Card values sum of ranks (Ace=11, King=10, Queen=10, Jack=10, Ten=10, 9=9, 7=7, 3=3). For Flush, need 5 same suit, can pick any 5 spades: S_K(10), S_J(10), S_T(10), S_7(7), S_3(3) = total 40. Score = (40+35)*4 = 75*4 = 300. That exactly meets target! But note we could also include extra cards up to 5 cards only. Flush uses 5; we have exactly 5 spades, so play those indices [1,3,4,6,7] (K,J,T,7,3). That's 5 cards, flush. Score 300. Adding to current 44 yields 344 > target, enough. However need to check we have 3 hands left, we can play just one hand and then end? Yes we can stop? I think after reaching target we can proceed to shop. So we should play flush hand.\n\nMake sure no jokers interfering. Good.\n\nThus we should use play with those indices. Let's output function call.\n\n"}]}, "native_finish_reason": "tool_calls"}], "created": 1767974282, "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_68dc251cf1e745386aca", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 599, "prompt_tokens": 12942, "total_tokens": 13541, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 402, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 10751, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.00497895, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.0045297, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00044925}}, "provider": "Cerebras"}}, "error": null}
